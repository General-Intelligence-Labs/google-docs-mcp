# FastMCP Google Docs Server

Connect Claude Desktop (or other MCP clients) to your Google Docs!

This server uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the `fastmcp` library to provide tools for reading and appending text to Google Documents. It acts as a bridge, allowing AI assistants like Claude to interact with your documents programmatically.

**Features:**

- **Read Documents:** Provides a `readGoogleDoc` tool to fetch the text content of a specified Google Doc.
- **Append to Documents:** Provides an `appendToGoogleDoc` tool to add text to the end of a specified Google Doc.
- **Google Authentication:** Handles the OAuth 2.0 flow to securely authorize access to your Google Account.
- **MCP Compliant:** Designed for use with MCP clients like Claude Desktop.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

1.  **Node.js and npm:** A recent version of Node.js (which includes npm) installed on your computer. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). (Version 18 or higher recommended).
2.  **Git:** Required for cloning this repository. ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)).
3.  **A Google Account:** The account that owns or has access to the Google Docs you want to interact with.
4.  **Command Line Familiarity:** Basic comfort using a terminal or command prompt (like Terminal on macOS/Linux, or Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows).
5.  **Claude Desktop (Optional):** If your goal is to connect this server to Claude, you'll need the Claude Desktop application installed.

---

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps carefully to get your own instance of the server running.

### Step 1: Google Cloud Project & Credentials (The Important Bit!)

This server needs permission to talk to Google APIs on your behalf. You'll create special "keys" (credentials) that only your server will use.

1.  **Go to Google Cloud Console:** Open your web browser and go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). You might need to log in with your Google Account.
2.  **Create or Select a Project:**
    - If you don't have a project, click the project dropdown near the top and select "NEW PROJECT". Give it a name (e.g., "My MCP Docs Server") and click "CREATE".
    - If you have existing projects, you can select one or create a new one.
3.  **Enable APIs:** You need to turn on the specific Google services this server uses.
    - In the search bar at the top, type "APIs & Services" and select "Library".
    - Search for "**Google Docs API**" and click on it. Then click the "**ENABLE**" button.
    - Search for "**Google Drive API**" and click on it. Then click the "**ENABLE**" button (this is often needed for finding files or permissions).
4.  **Configure OAuth Consent Screen:** This screen tells users (usually just you) what your app wants permission for.
    - On the left menu, click "APIs & Services" -> "**OAuth consent screen**".
    - Choose User Type: Select "**External**" and click "CREATE".
    - Fill in App Information:
      - **App name:** Give it a name users will see (e.g., "Claude Docs MCP Access").
      - **User support email:** Select your email address.
      - **Developer contact information:** Enter your email address.
    - Click "**SAVE AND CONTINUE**".
    - **Scopes:** Click "**ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES**". Search for and add the following scopes:
      - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents` (Allows reading/writing docs)
      - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` (Allows access to specific files opened/created by the app)
      - Click "**UPDATE**".
    - Click "**SAVE AND CONTINUE**".
    - **Test Users:** Click "**ADD USERS**". Enter the same Google email address you are logged in with. Click "**ADD**". This allows _you_ to use the app while it's in "testing" mode.
    - Click "**SAVE AND CONTINUE**". Review the summary and click "**BACK TO DASHBOARD**".
5.  **Create Credentials (The Keys!):**
    - On the left menu, click "APIs & Services" -> "**Credentials**".
    - Click "**+ CREATE CREDENTIALS**" at the top and choose "**OAuth client ID**".
    - **Application type:** Select "**Desktop app**" from the dropdown.
    - **Name:** Give it a name (e.g., "MCP Docs Desktop Client").
    - Click "**CREATE**".
6.  **⬇️ DOWNLOAD THE CREDENTIALS FILE:** A box will pop up showing your Client ID. Click the "**DOWNLOAD JSON**" button.
    - Save this file. It will likely be named something like `client_secret_....json`.
    - **IMPORTANT:** Rename the downloaded file to exactly `credentials.json`.
7.  ⚠️ **SECURITY WARNING:** Treat this `credentials.json` file like a password! Do not share it publicly, and **never commit it to GitHub.** Anyone with this file could potentially pretend to be _your application_ (though they'd still need user consent to access data).

### Step 2: Get the Server Code

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/a-bonus/google-docs-mcp.git mcp-googledocs-server
    ```
2.  **Navigate into Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd mcp-googledocs-server
    ```
3.  **Place Credentials:** Move or copy the `credentials.json` file you downloaded and renamed (from Step 1.6) directly into this `mcp-googledocs-server` folder.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Your server needs some helper libraries specified in the `package.json` file.

1.  In your terminal (make sure you are inside the `mcp-googledocs-server` directory), run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This will download and install all the necessary packages into a `node_modules` folder.

### Step 4: Build the Server Code

The server is written in TypeScript (`.ts`), but we need to compile it into JavaScript (`.js`) that Node.js can run directly.

1.  In your terminal, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This uses the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to create a `dist` folder containing the compiled JavaScript files.

### Step 5: First Run & Google Authorization (One Time Only)

Now you need to run the server once manually to grant it permission to access your Google account data. This will create a `token.json` file that saves your permission grant.

1.  In your terminal, run the _compiled_ server using `node`:
    ```bash
    node ./dist/server.js
    ```
2.  **Watch the Terminal:** The script will print:
    - Status messages (like "Attempting to authorize...").
    - An "Authorize this app by visiting this url:" message followed by a long `https://accounts.google.com/...` URL.
3.  **Authorize in Browser:**
    - Copy the entire long URL from the terminal.
    - Paste the URL into your web browser and press Enter.
    - Log in with the **same Google account** you added as a Test User in Step 1.4.
    - Google will show a screen asking for permission for your app ("Claude Docs MCP Access" or similar) to access Google Docs/Drive. Review and click "**Allow**" or "**Grant**".
4.  **Get the Authorization Code:**
    - After clicking Allow, your browser will likely try to redirect to `http://localhost` and show a **"This site can't be reached" error**. **THIS IS NORMAL!**
    - Look **carefully** at the URL in your browser's address bar. It will look like `http://localhost/?code=4/0Axxxxxxxxxxxxxx&scope=...`
    - Copy the long string of characters **between `code=` and the `&scope` part**. This is your single-use authorization code.
5.  **Paste Code into Terminal:** Go back to your terminal where the script is waiting ("Enter the code from that page here:"). Paste the code you just copied.
6.  **Press Enter.**
7.  **Success!** The script should print:
    - "Authentication successful!"
    - "Token stored to .../token.json"
    - It will then finish starting and likely print "Awaiting MCP client connection via stdio..." or similar, and then exit (or you can press `Ctrl+C` to stop it).
8.  ✅ **Check:** You should now see a new file named `token.json` in your `mcp-googledocs-server` folder.
9.  ⚠️ **SECURITY WARNING:** This `token.json` file contains the key that allows the server to access your Google account _without_ asking again. Protect it like a password. **Do not commit it to GitHub.** The included `.gitignore` file should prevent this automatically.

### Step 6: Configure Claude Desktop (Optional)

If you want to use this server with Claude Desktop, you need to tell Claude how to run it.

1.  **Find Your Absolute Path:** You need the full path to the server code.
    - In your terminal, make sure you are still inside the `mcp-googledocs-server` directory.
    - Run the `pwd` command (on macOS/Linux) or `cd` (on Windows, just displays the path).
    - Copy the full path (e.g., `/Users/yourname/projects/mcp-googledocs-server` or `C:\Users\yourname\projects\mcp-googledocs-server`).
2.  **Locate `mcp_config.json`:** Find Claude's configuration file:
    - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/mcp_config.json` (You might need to use Finder's "Go" -> "Go to Folder..." menu and paste `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/`)
    - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\mcp_config.json` (Paste `%APPDATA%\Claude` into File Explorer's address bar)
    - **Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/mcp_config.json`
    - _If the `Claude` folder or `mcp_config.json` file doesn't exist, create them._
3.  **Edit `mcp_config.json`:** Open the file in a text editor. Add or modify the `mcpServers` section like this, **replacing `/PATH/TO/YOUR/CLONED/REPO` with the actual absolute path you copied in Step 6.1**:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "google-docs-mcp": {
          "command": "node",
          "args": [
            "/PATH/TO/YOUR/CLONED/REPO/mcp-googledocs-server/dist/server.js"
          ],
          "env": {}
        }
        // Add commas here if you have other servers defined
      }
      // Other Claude settings might be here
    }
    ```

    - **Make sure the path in `"args"` is correct and absolute!**
    - If the file already existed, carefully merge this entry into the existing `mcpServers` object. Ensure the JSON is valid (check commas!).

4.  **Save `mcp_config.json`.**
5.  **Restart Claude Desktop:** Close Claude completely and reopen it.

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Once configured, you should be able to use the tools in your chats with Claude:

- "Use the `google-docs-mcp` server to read the document with ID `YOUR_GOOGLE_DOC_ID`."
- "Can you get the content of Google Doc `YOUR_GOOGLE_DOC_ID`?"
- "Append 'This was added by Claude!' to document `YOUR_GOOGLE_DOC_ID` using the `google-docs-mcp` tool."

Remember to replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_DOC_ID` with the actual ID from a Google Doc's URL (the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`).

Claude will automatically launch your server in the background when needed using the command you provided. You do **not** need to run `node ./dist/server.js` manually anymore.

---

## Security & Token Storage

- **`.gitignore`:** This repository includes a `.gitignore` file which should prevent you from accidentally committing your sensitive `credentials.json` and `token.json` files. **Do not remove these lines from `.gitignore`**.
- **Token Storage:** This server stores the Google authorization token (`token.json`) directly in the project folder for simplicity during setup. In production or more security-sensitive environments, consider storing this token more securely, such as using system keychains, encrypted files, or dedicated secret management services.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Claude shows "Failed" or "Could not attach":**
  - Double-check the absolute path in `mcp_config.json`.
  - Ensure you ran `npm run build` successfully and the `dist` folder exists.
  - Try running the command from `mcp_config.json` manually in your terminal: `node /PATH/TO/YOUR/CLONED/REPO/mcp-googledocs-server/dist/server.js`. Look for any errors printed.
  - Check the Claude Desktop logs (see the official MCP debugging guide).
  - Make sure all `console.log` status messages in the server code were changed to `console.error`.
- **Google Authorization Errors:**
  - Ensure you enabled the correct APIs (Docs, Drive).
  - Make sure you added your email as a Test User on the OAuth Consent Screen.
  - Verify the `credentials.json` file is correctly placed in the project root.

## Tool Improvement Ideas (Advanced)

Okay, looking at that interaction log, you've hit the nail on the head:
The Problem: Claude (or any LLM) is terrible at calculating precise character indices (startIndex, endIndex) within a dynamically changing document. Every time text is added or formatted, the indices for everything after that point shift. Claude's attempts to format are based on the indices before the previous operation completed, leading to incorrect ranges being formatted. The fact it sometimes works is almost luck, depending on whether preceding operations significantly shifted the target indices.
Relying on passing exact indices from the LLM for formatting anything beyond the very start of the document is fundamentally brittle and won't scale.
Ideas for Improvement (Moving from Index-Based to Content/Semantic-Based Formatting):
Here are several ways to make this much more robust and useful:
1. Tool: formatMatchingText (Most Impactful Improvement)
Concept: Instead of indices, tell the tool what text to find and format. The server finds the text and applies formatting to its range.
New Parameters:
documentId: string
textToFind: string (The exact text string to search for)
matchInstance: number (Optional, default 1. Find the 1st, 2nd, Nth occurrence)
formatting: object (Contains the optional formatting options like bold, italic, fontSize, foregroundColor, linkUrl, etc. - same as before)
Server Logic:
Use the Google Docs API's replaceAllText request within batchUpdate.
Crucially: Configure replaceAllText to replace the found text with the exact same text but apply the desired TextStyle changes simultaneously. This effectively formats without changing content.
The replaceAllText request allows specifying text to find and replaceText (which would be the same as text), and you can nest a TextStyle update within it or apply it to the range found. You might need to experiment with the exact structure, possibly using replaceAllText just to find the range, then using a separate updateTextStyle request in the same batchUpdate call targeting that found range. (Alternatively, use the textStyle field directly within replaceAllText if the API supports that nuance).
Handle cases where the text isn't found or multiple instances exist (using matchInstance).
Benefit: Claude just needs to know the text ("Alain Bonus", "PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE") and the desired style, not the indices. This is much more natural for an LLM.
2. Tool: setParagraphStyleByText
Concept: Similar to formatMatchingText, but for paragraph-level styles (headers, alignment, spacing). Find text within a paragraph and apply style to the whole paragraph containing it.
New Parameters:
documentId: string
textWithinParagraph: string (Text to find to identify the paragraph)
matchInstance: number (Optional, default 1)
paragraphStyle: object (Contains options like namedStyleType ("HEADING_1", "NORMAL_TEXT"), alignment ("CENTER"), spaceAbove, spaceBelow, indentStart, etc.)
Server Logic:
Requires multiple steps:
Get the document content (documents.get).
Parse the content to find the specified textWithinParagraph and identify the start/end indices of the paragraph element containing it. This is the hardest part - you need to iterate through the body.content array and look at paragraph elements and their startIndex/endIndex.
Construct an UpdateParagraphStyleRequest using the found paragraph startIndex and endIndex.
Specify the desired paragraphStyle properties and the fields mask.
Send the request via batchUpdate.
Benefit: Allows setting headers (H1, H2), alignment, etc., semantically without indices.
3. Tool: applyMultipleFormats (Batching)
Concept: Allow Claude to request multiple formatting changes in a single call for efficiency.
New Parameters:
documentId: string
formatRequests: array of objects. Each object could contain:
textToFind: string (for character or paragraph formatting)
matchInstance: number (optional)
characterFormatting: object (optional, like formatText options)
paragraphFormatting: object (optional, like setParagraphStyleByText options)
(Alternative: Could use startIndex/endIndex instead of textToFind for specific cases, but less robust)
Server Logic:
Iterate through the formatRequests array.
For each request, determine the target range (either by finding text or using provided indices).
Construct the appropriate UpdateTextStyleRequest or UpdateParagraphStyleRequest.
Collect all constructed requests into a single list.
Send the entire list in one batchUpdate call.
Benefit: Dramatically reduces the number of back-and-forth calls between Claude and the MCP server, making formatting much faster.
4. Enhancement: Improve appendToGoogleDoc (Optional Advanced)
Concept: Allow appendToGoogleDoc to accept Markdown or a simple structured format and apply basic formatting automatically on insertion.
Example Parameter: textToAppend: string (could contain Markdown like ## Header or **bold**)
Server Logic:
Append the text plainly first.
Get the index range of the appended text.
Parse the appended text for Markdown/structure cues.
Generate a series of UpdateTextStyleRequest / UpdateParagraphStyleRequest objects based on the parsing.
Send these formatting requests in a batchUpdate call after appending.
Benefit: Simplifies the initial creation step. More complex to implement reliably.
Implementation Steps:
Choose an Approach: Start with formatMatchingText (Tool #1) as it solves the biggest problem. Then consider adding paragraph formatting (#2) and batching (#3).
Define Zod Schema: Create the Zod schemas for the new tool's parameters.
Implement Server Logic: Write the execute function for the new tool(s), carefully using the Google Docs API's batchUpdate with replaceAllText (for styling) or updateParagraphStyle requests. Remember to calculate ranges correctly on the server based on finding text.
Update server.ts: Add the new tool using server.addTool({...}).
Build and Test: Run npm run build and test thoroughly with Claude or other MCP clients, focusing on edge cases (text not found, multiple matches, etc.).
By shifting away from client-provided indices towards server-side text searching and semantic actions, you'll create a vastly more robust and usable formatting experience for Claude.
